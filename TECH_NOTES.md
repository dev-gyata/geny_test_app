# Architecture Overview

This app uses a modular architecture for maintainability and scalability:

- **lib/core/**: Shared configs, models, services, and utilities.
- **lib/features/**: Feature-based organization (e.g., home, app) for separation of concerns.
- **l10n/**: Localization using ARB files and generated Dart code.
- **Platform folders (android/, ios/, macos/)**: Native code and build configs for each platform.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Uses dependency injection for decoupling and testability. All Dependencies are injected via constructors making it easier to swap out dependencies.
- **Abstraction**: Uses abstract classes for separating concerns and abstracting implementations. Making it easier to swap out actual implementations.

## Key Trade-offs

- **Simplicity vs. Flexibility**: Chose a straightforward structure and dependency injection for fast onboarding, at the cost of flexibility for complex scenarios.
- **Code Generation**: Uses build_runner for injectable which speeds up development but can obscure logic for new contributors.
- **Testing**: I Focused on unit tests for repository, notifier, and interceptors, with less emphasis on full integration or end-to-end tests due to time constraints.

## Areas for Improvement

- **State Management**: Could adopt a more robust solution (e.g., Bloc, Riverpod) for larger scale.
- **Error Handling**: Expand error handling/reporting, especially for network and platform-specific issues.
- **CI/CD**: Integrate automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize for startup time and memory usage.
- **Documentation**: Add more detailed developer and API docs.
- **Models**: Could have gone for a more robust for data models like freezed.
- **Code Generation**: Could have removed generated code to make it easier to maintain.

This structure provides a solid foundation for growth, with clear paths for future enhancements.
